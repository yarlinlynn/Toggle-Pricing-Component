```bash
Toggle-Pricing-Component/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML structure

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
All you need is a modern web browser.

### ðŸ“¥ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yarlinlynn/Toggle-Pricing-Component.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd Toggle-Pricing-Component
```
3. Open index.html in your browser:
```
open index.html    # macOS
# OR
start index.html   # Windows
```
### ðŸ§ª How It Works
- A custom toggle switch (checkbox input styled with CSS) controls the visibility of two pricing sets.
- The pricing amounts for Monthly and Annually are embedded in the HTML using span tags.
- CSS pseudo-classes (:checked, ~, etc.) control which pricing tier is visible based on toggle state.
